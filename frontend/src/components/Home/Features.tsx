            <p>
            In a decentralized blockchain network, no one has to know or trust anyone else. 
            Each member in the network has a copy of the exact same data in the form of a distributed ledger. 
            If a member's ledger is altered or corrupted in any way, it will be rejected by the majority of the members in the network.

            A distributed ledger can be described as a ledger of any transactions or
             contracts maintained in decentralized form across different locations and people.
